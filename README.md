# A Hello World Sample Code in C



This is a little collection of hello world in C:
* hello_01 is the most basic hello world in C, with a Makefile showing the build command.
* hello_02_shared_lib is a bit more enhanced hello world in C, with a more robust Makefile and creating/linking a .so shared library.
